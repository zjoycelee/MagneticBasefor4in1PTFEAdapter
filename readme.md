# Bambulab 4-in-1 Adapter Holder with Magnetic Mount

This project provides 3D models for a **Bambulab 4-in-1 Adapter Holder** designed for easy attachment to the backplate of the **Bambu P1S/X1 3D printers**. The holder uses magnets for quick attachment and detachment, offering flexibility to easily move and adjust the adapter.

## Features

- **Magnetic Mount**: The holder uses magnets to attach securely to the backplate of the Bambu P1S/X1 3D printers.
- **Easy to Move and Adjust**: The magnetic attachment allows for simple repositioning of the adapter holder without the need for additional tools.
- **Space-saving**: The holder ensures the 4-in-1 adapter stays close to the backplate, minimizing clutter and maximizing space on your 3D printer.

## Advantages

- **Flexible Adjustment**: The magnetic mount makes it easy to reposition the adapter holder, giving you full control over the placement and ensuring it fits your workspace perfectly.
- **Convenient Movement**: Unlike fixed mounts, this solution allows you to move the adapter holder quickly and easily, without the hassle of screws or complicated installations.
- **Close Fit to the Backplate**: The design ensures that the adapter holder stays as close as possible to the backplate, optimizing space while maintaining a secure fit.

This image demonstrates how to install the magnets to ensure the adapter holder is securely attached to the backplate of the Bambu P1S/X1 printer.

## Assembly Instructions

1. **Print the Holder**: Download the 3D model files from the repository and print them using your 3D printer.
2. **Attach the Magnets**: Insert the magnets (D=6mm, H=3mm) into the designated holes on the holder.
3. **Mount on the Backplate**: Attach the magnetic holder to the backplate of your Bambu P1S/X1 printer. The magnets will hold the adapter securely in place.
4. **Adjust and Move**: You can now easily move and adjust the position of the adapter holder on the backplate for optimal space management.
